# Deploy - bundle runbook, explorer pointing, gateway mode

Nginx configs: [docs/deploy/](./deploy/).

## Bundle-stack bring-up runbook

One TLS host, six bundle binaries + content core, all loopback, path-routed by a reverse proxy ([deploy/nginx-catalyrst-bundles.conf](./deploy/nginx-catalyrst-bundles.conf)).

| Process | Default port | Members |
|---|---|---|
| catalyrst-live | 5141 (`HTTP_SERVER_PORT`) | content, lambdas, about |
| catalyrst-explore | 5143 | places, events, archipelago, worlds, map, lists |
| catalyrst-create | 5144 | builder, camera-reel |
| catalyrst-social | 5145 | communities, comms, notifications, badges, media |
| catalyrst-data | 5146 | market, economy, price, credits, rpc |
| abgen | 5147 | asset-bundle CDN + AB-registry + in-process converter (upstream decentraland/abgen) |
| catalyrst-social-rpc | 5148 | dcl-rpc WebSocket (friends/voice) |
| catalyrst-market | 5133 | standalone marketplace (optional; data already serves `/v1`) |

Bundles bind `BUNDLE_HTTP_PORT` on loopback; any port range works. Prereqs: PostgreSQL 18, squid marketplace DB populated, content DB synced, LiveKit SFU reachable.

1. Build - pin binaries at stable paths (symlink from `target/release/`):

```bash
for b in explore create social data abgen social-rpc; do
  cargo build --release --bin catalyrst-$b
done
cargo build --release --bin catalyrst-live
# NixOS: use an FHS/nix shell - see ./build-and-test.md
```

2. Least-privilege DB roles - `_ro` read-only, `_rw` owner (runs sqlx migrations at `build_state()`):

```bash
PSQL="psql -h <DB_HOST> -p <DB_PORT> -U <DB_ADMIN>"
$PSQL -c "CREATE ROLE cat_explore_ro LOGIN PASSWORD '...';"   # + cat_data_ro, cat_content_ro
$PSQL -c "CREATE ROLE cat_create_rw  LOGIN PASSWORD '...';"   # + cat_social_rw, cat_data_rw

# explore reads places_events + marketplace + content
for db in places_events marketplace content; do
  $PSQL -d $db -c "GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE $db TO cat_explore_ro;"
  $PSQL -d $db -c "GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO cat_explore_ro;"
  $PSQL -d $db -c "GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO cat_explore_ro;"
  $PSQL -d $db -c "ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT TO cat_explore_ro;"
done
# data reads marketplace schemas, owns credits
$PSQL -d marketplace -c "GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA marketplace, favorites, squid_marketplace TO cat_data_ro;"
$PSQL -d marketplace -c "GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA marketplace, favorites, squid_marketplace TO cat_data_ro;"
$PSQL -c "CREATE DATABASE credits OWNER cat_data_rw;"
# abgen owns ab_registry (registry surface), reads content; social owns its four DBs
$PSQL -c "CREATE DATABASE ab_registry OWNER cat_create_rw;"
for db in communities comms_gatekeeper notifications badges; do
  $PSQL -c "CREATE DATABASE $db OWNER cat_social_rw;"
done
```

3. Env files - a bundle's env file concatenates its members'. Duplicate `HTTP_SERVER_PORT`/`HTTP_SERVER_HOST` keys are harmless (only `BUNDLE_HTTP_PORT` binds); check overlapping keys resolve as intended. `chmod 600` everything.

- `catalyrst-live` auto-loads `/etc/catalyrst/content.env` at boot.
- LiveKit: comms/worlds fail fast without `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`/`_SECRET` (`LIVEKIT_ALLOW_DEV_CREDS=1` for dev defaults); set key/secret/`LIVEKIT_HOST`/`LIVEKIT_WEBHOOK_KEY` identically across explore+social - one SFU, see [operations.md](./operations.md). The NixOS module provisions and keys an SFU for you; on this manual path you supply it - see [comms and entry](#comms-and-entry) for what happens when it is missing.
- Money endpoints (credits/market/economy) need an admin token to bind beyond loopback.
- Template units: `nixos/systemd/catalyrst-*.service` (fill `<WORKSPACE>`/`<DATA_DIR>`, `EnvironmentFile=`).

### Comms and entry

A dead SFU does not cost you voice, it costs you the realm. The desktop client
runs the LiveKit handshake as a gate on entry, not as a background task: its
result overwrites the scene-load result, so on timeout the loading screen never
completes and the visitor is thrown back to the login screen, retrying every 30
seconds. Content that is entirely healthy is unreachable for a reason nothing in
the symptom points at.

Both `/about` implementations therefore probe the endpoint they advertise -
`LIVEKIT_HOST` when set, otherwise whatever `COMMS_FIXED_ADAPTER` points at,
since a gatekeeper that cannot mint a token bounces entry the same way - and
serve `fixed-adapter:offline:offline` while it is silent. Visitors enter
single-player and get full comms on their next entry once it answers. The
operator console shows a red `COMMS DOWN` banner naming the endpoint and how
long it has been down.

The probe assumes the SFU is alive until three consecutive checks fail (10s
apart, 2s timeout), so restarting a service never mutes a healthy realm. Set
`WORLDS_COMMS_OFFLINE_WHEN_UNREACHABLE=0` / `COMMS_OFFLINE_WHEN_UNREACHABLE=0`
to opt out and always advertise the configured adapter.

Per-world, `single_player` forces `offline:offline` regardless of SFU state -
useful for a content-only walk-in before comms is wired at all.

### Mirroring a world onto this node

`worlds-mirror` copies a world's scenes and blobs from another worlds server
(`CONTENTS_UPSTREAM_URL`), no wallet involved:

```bash
CONTENTS_UPSTREAM_URL=https://worlds-content-server.decentraland.org \
  worlds-mirror --name myworld.dcl.eth
```

It refuses to overwrite a world that was published *here* - a mirror would
replace signed content with someone else's copy - and says so on its own line:

```
!! REFUSED myworld.dcl.eth: already published to this node by 0xabc... Re-run with --name myworld.dcl.eth --force to overwrite it.
```

`--force` does the overwrite, and requires `--name`: it is never applied across
a whole index run. The run's tail separates `skipped` (nothing upstream) from
`refused` (a local publish) from `failed` (an error), so a deliberate refusal
never reads as a broken run.

A mirrored world takes the upstream server's `spawnCoordinates` when it
publishes one. When it does not, a spawn set locally through
`PUT /world/<name>/settings` is preserved, and the first scene's base parcel is
the last resort.

4. Realm discovery (`/about`) - clients discover the realm via `GET /about`; point content core's public URLs at the TLS host:

```ini
PUBLIC_URL=https://realm.example.com
CONTENT_URL=https://realm.example.com/content/     # trailing path matters
LAMBDAS_URL=https://realm.example.com/lambdas/
CONTENT_SERVER_ADDRESS=https://realm.example.com/content
REALM_NAME=my-realm
COMMS_PROTOCOL=v3
COMMS_FIXED_ADAPTER=signed-login:https://realm.example.com/comms-gatekeeper/get-scene-adapter
```

The client reads `content.publicUrl`, `lambdas.publicUrl`, `comms.adapter`/`comms.protocol` from `/about` - never a static URL.

5. Start order + health - reload proxy with the bundle server block:

```bash
systemctl --user start catalyrst.service           # content core first
systemctl --user start catalyrst-explore.service   # depends on content
systemctl --user start catalyrst-{create,social,data,abgen}.service
systemctl --user start catalyrst-social-rpc.service  # after social (gatekeeper)

for p in 5143 5144 5145 5146; do curl -s localhost:$p/health | jq .; done
# {"status":"ok","members":{...:"up"}}; "degraded" names the down member - bundles fail soft
```

6. Smoke tests - loopback:

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:5143/api/places?limit=1' | jq '.data|length'
curl -s 'localhost:5143/api/events' | jq '.total'
curl -s 'localhost:5143/pois' | jq 'length'
curl -s 'localhost:5144/profiles/metadata' -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n'
curl -s 'localhost:5145/v1/communities?limit=1' | jq '.data|length'
curl -s 'localhost:5146/v1/catalog?first=1' | jq '.data|length'
curl -s 'localhost:5146/api/v3/simple/price?ids=decentraland&vs_currencies=usd' | jq .
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' 'localhost:5147/manifest/doesnotexist_windows.json'  # 404
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -H 'Connection: Upgrade' -H 'Upgrade: websocket' \
  -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Key: x' -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13' localhost:5148/   # 101/426
```

Through the edge:

```bash
H=https://realm.example.com
curl -s "$H/about" | jq '.healthy, .configurations.realmName'
curl -s "$H/content/status" | jq '.version'
# spot parity vs upstream
diff <(curl -s "$H/api/places?limit=1" | jq -S .) \
     <(curl -s 'https://places.decentraland.org/api/places?limit=1' | jq -S .) | head
```

Green = every `/health` ok, edge `/about` `healthy:true`, smoke curls return data.

7. Teardown / notes

```bash
systemctl --user stop catalyrst-{explore,create,social,data,abgen,social-rpc}.service
# repoint the proxy; the content core is independent and can stay up
```

- Standalone `catalyrst-market` isolates marketplace from economy/price/credits; nginx `X-Accel-Redirect` (`STORAGE_X_ACCEL_BASE`) gives zero-copy content-serving throughput.

## Pointing the Unity explorer at catalyrst (full-coverage model)

Zero-client-change subset alternative: Gateway mode below.

Three layers resolve every backend to catalyrst:

1. Client URL rewrite - `CatalyrstUrlsSource` (`DecentralandUrlsSource` subclass) rewrites every statically-known `https://{service}.decentraland.{env}` host to `{CATALYRST_BASE}/{prefix}`; one construction site, `MainSceneLoader.cs`.
2. Realm `/about` discovery - `Lambdas`/`Content`/`EntitiesDeployment` (+ `EntitiesActive` fallback) derive from `/about`. Default without a CLI flag: point `Genesis` (`/realm-provider/main`) at a response listing this host.
3. Edge path-routing - one front host; nginx strips a per-upstream prefix, forwards to the owning bundle.

Prefixes map upstream *subdomains*, not crates: upstreams sharing a bundle are told apart by the prefix nginx strips.

Prefix -> bundle routing (ports deployment-assigned):

| Front-host prefix | Upstream it stands in for | Target |
|---|---|---|
| `/content/`, `/lambdas/`, `/about`, `/status` (kept, not stripped) | realm content core | live |
| `/peer/` (rewrite `/peer/(.*) -> /$1`) | `peer.decentraland.org` catalyst | live |
| `/places/`, `/events/`, `/archipelago/`, `/realm-provider/`, `/worlds-content-server/`, `/map-api/`, `/lists/` | respective upstreams | explore |
| `/builder-api/`, `/camera-reel/`, `/ab-registry/` | builder-api, camera-reel-service, asset-bundle-registry | create |
| `/social-api/`, `/comms-gatekeeper/`, `/notifications/`, `/badges/`, `/media/`, `/assets-cdn/` | social stack | social |
| `/credits/`, `/rpc/` (ws) | credits, rpc relay | data |
| `/market/` | marketplace-server | market (or data) |
| `/ab-cdn/` | ab-cdn | abgen |
| `/social-rpc/` (ws) | rpc-social-service-ea | social-rpc |

`location /places/ { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/; }` - trailing slash strips prefix. WebSocket prefixes (`/rpc/`, `/social-rpc/`) need `proxy_http_version 1.1` + `Upgrade`/`Connection`.

Not rewritten: web links (`decentraland.org` web-app, Discord/Twitter/OpenSea/docs/reels, the CoinGecko rate URL) pass through unchanged - suffixes match the pattern, self-hosting any is one prefix-map entry. Crate-less services proxy straight to their upstream.

## Gateway mode - the stock explorer's gateway contract

Behind `USE_GATEWAY` (`GatewayUrlsSource`), unity-explorer rewrites every supported service URL onto one gateway host:

```
https://{subdomain}.decentraland.{env}/{path}  ->  https://{gateway}/{subdomain}/{path}
```

Path untouched; edge strips the leading subdomain - no explorer code change. Config: [deploy/nginx-catalyrst-gateway.conf](./deploy/nginx-catalyrst-gateway.conf).

`GatewayUrlsSource.SUPPORTED_URLS` subdomains route (+ `profile-images`). `Profiles` rides the `asset-bundle-registry` prefix (`{AssetBundleRegistry}/profiles`) - no separate `/profiles` prefix.

| Gateway subdomain | Bundle | Routed `DecentralandUrl`s |
|---|---|---|
| `places` | explore | ApiPlaces, ApiWorlds, ApiDestinations, Map, ContentModerationReport |
| `api` | explore | ApiChunks (`/v1/map.png`, `/v2/*` tiles) |
| `archipelago-ea-stats` | explore | ArchipelagoStatus, ArchipelagoHotScenes, RemotePeers |
| `worlds-content-server` | explore | WorldContentServer, RemotePeersWorld |
| `realm-provider-ea` | explorer-api | Genesis (`/main`) |
| `auth-api` | explorer-api | ApiAuth |
| `asset-bundle-registry` | create | AssetBundleRegistry(+Version), Profiles, EntitiesActiveElements |
| `camera-reel-service` | create | CameraReelImages/Places/Users |
| `social-api` | social | Communities, Members, ActiveCommunityVoiceChats |
| `comms-gatekeeper` | social | GateKeeperSceneAdapter, ChatAdapter, GatekeeperStatus, BannedUsers |
| `notifications` | social | Notifications |
| `badges` | social | Badges |
| `metamorph-api` | social | MediaConverter (`/convert`) |
| `assets-cdn` | social | CommunityThumbnail |
| `credits` | data | MarketplaceCredits |
| `ab-cdn` | ab-cdn | AssetBundlesCDN |
| `profile-images` | profile-images | profile thumbnails |

Not covered:

- Realm content/lambdas/about: from `/about`, served natively on the realm host; gateway conf includes those locations - one host can be both, drop for a pure gateway host.
- Never gateway-routed: `events`, `dcl-lists` (POI), `market`, `builder-api`, `rpc` relay, `social-rpc` WebSocket. Full self-hosting needs the full-coverage model.

Stock explorer: pin DNS/`/etc/hosts` so `gateway.decentraland.org`+`.zone` resolve here, set `server_name`, or use an explorer-side override - the transform only fires for `.decentraland.{org,zone}` hosts.
