/// @title LandilerEscrow
/// @notice 15-day reclaimable custody escrow for Decentraland wearables/emotes
///         bought through the Landiler fiat -> Credits -> NFT marketplace.
///
/// Decentraland wearables/emotes are plain ERC-721s with no per-token update
/// operator (unlike LAND), so a transfer-lock cannot be enforced by a flag on
/// the token -- the only way to make an item non-transferable for the return
/// window is to hold it in custody. This contract is that custody, modeled on
/// `decentraland/rentals-contract`'s `Rentals.sol` (custody via
/// `onERC721Received` + `safeTransferFrom` into the contract, an `endDate`-style
/// timelock per token, and a `claim()` that transfers the asset back out):
///
///   * The broker buys each NFT straight to this contract (primary mint with
///     `beneficiaries:[escrow]`, or a secondary buy forwarded here). On receipt
///     the contract records `{buyer, unlockAt = now + 15 days}` for the token.
///   * BEFORE `unlockAt`, only the operator can `reclaim(...)` the token -- used
///     when the buyer is refunded inside the return window; the asset is
///     retained by Landiler (sent to the operator) and re-sold.
///   * AT/AFTER `unlockAt`, `release(...)` transfers the token to the recorded
///     buyer, ending the lease -- the buyer then holds the NFT on-chain and it is
///     portable network-wide.
///
/// Off-chain, catalyrst's `marketplace.usage_grants` overlay makes the in-escrow
/// item still render on the buyer's avatar and in their backpack (flagged
/// "leased") across all six ownership-resolution sites during the window. The
/// chain is the source of truth for the lock; the overlay is purely UX.
///
