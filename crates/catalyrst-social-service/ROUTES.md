# catalyrst-communities - HTTP route inventory

Ported from `decentraland/social-service-ea/src/controllers/routes/http.routes.ts`, community
routes only (friends, referrals, user-mutes, and SQS handlers are out of scope for this crate).
Listening port: 5136.

`Sign`: `optional` = `signedFetchMiddleware({ optional: true })` (handler runs with or
without an auth chain; behaviour differs by `verification?.auth`); `required` =
`signedFetchMiddleware()` (401 without a valid auth chain); `bearer` =
`bearerTokenMiddleware(API_ADMIN_TOKEN)` (requires `Authorization: Bearer ...`).

`Status`: `GET` = implemented read path, queries the local `communities` DB; `WRITE` =
federation write path implemented (accepts `Signed<T>`, verifies + replay-checks +
authority-gates + persists, returns `200 { ok: true, signature_hash }` on success); `501` =
surface not modelled as a `Signed<T>` in v1 (TODO.md "Deferred to v2").

## Federation endpoints - 2

| Method | Path                                              | Sign | Status |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|------|--------|

## Excluded from this crate (in upstream `http.routes.ts`, not community routes)

- `POST/PATCH/GET /v1/referral-progress`
- `POST /v1/referral-email`
- `GET/POST/DELETE /v1/mutes` (global user mutes, unrelated to community state)

## Totals

- Total routes inventoried: 35
- GETs ported: 14 (+ 1 ping handler = 15 route entries; ping has no auth)
- Writes stubbed (501): 18 (`POST` + `PUT` + `PATCH` + `DELETE` + the bearer-token batch read
  endpoint that needs admin-token wiring out of scope).
